            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Rafting companies emerged in the mid-20th century as adventure tourism grew,
                evolving from ancient
                river navigation practices into organized businesses offering guided whitewater
                experiences. Today,
                they not only provide recreation but also play a role in river conservation and
                global sporting
                events. </p>
